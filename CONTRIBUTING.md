# Contributing to the Project

Please review the following guidelines in order to make the contribution process effective and easy for everyone. 


## Governance
SynBioPython will be governed using a three-tiered system of contributors:
1. Five Editors, which have to be members of the GBA. Editors will be elected by members of the core team (see b)) and they will have to self-nominate. Editors serve 2 year-long terms.
2. The Core Team members, which are approved by the Editors after submitting an Expression of Interest to them.. The Core Team stays in regular contact (email group/calls) to discuss development of SynBioPython.
3. Ad-hoc contributors which contribute through posting issues in Github or submitting ideas/changes via email/any other communication route. There is no regular contact between ad-hoc contributors and Editors/Core Team.

SynBioPython is released on GitHub under the MIT licence. The project is committed to remain free and open source under a licence approved by the [FSF](https://www.fsf.org) and the [OSI](https://opensource.org).


## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. Please do so before submitting:
* Check if the feature has already been requested.
* Ensure your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
* Please provide details (i.e. explaining the use case (merits of the feature))


## Issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for bug reports, and feature requests, but please respect the following restrictions:
* Never use the issue tracker for personal support requests (use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) or [Bioinformatics SE](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com)).
* Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.


## Contributions

We welcome commits from contributors. We will consider code that is relevant to synthetic biology and meets the following criteria:
* you have the legal right to contribute the code under the project's licence
* the contribution follows the coding style outlined below
* docstrings are included in the code, if applicable
* tests are written for new code & all tests pass

For bigger contributions, such as modules or addition of dependencies, please contact the core team for a discussion and approval. Contributions should be submitted as GitHub pull requests. New feature or bug fix pull requests are reviewed and merged by a core team member. Large contributions, such as modules, are reviewed by at least two core team members.


## Coding conventions

SynBioPython conforms to Black and Flake8 requirements, which are enforced using pre-commit hooks.

Documentation is generated using [Portray](https://github.com/timothycrosley/portray).

Tests are included for each function, with total code coverage >90%.

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/github/Global-Biofoundries-Alliance/SynBioPython) is used for continuous integration.

The project follows the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) scheme. Major versions are prepared into [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Global-Biofoundries-Alliance/SynBioPython/releases) and also uploaded to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/synbiopython/) (Python Package Index).


## Get started!

1. Firstly, press the "fork" button in GitHub to create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account. 
2. Now you need to clone locally using a terminal:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:yourname/SynBioPython.git
```
3. Change into the new local directory:
```
cd SynBioPython
```
4. Set up a new remote that points to the original project repository
```
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:Global-Biofoundries-Alliance/SynBioPython.git
```
5. Put each piece of work on its own branch
```
$ git checkout master
$ git pull upstream master && git push origin master
$ git checkout -b feature/Xfeature-update
```
This creates branch from master then the pull command will sync our local copy with the upstream project. The git push will sync it to our forked GitHub project. Finally, create the new branch where you include your updated feature.

6. When you're done with making changes, ensure that your changes pass both black and flake8 before committing your staged Python files. Black is the uncompromising Python Code Formatter. It will reformat your entire file in place according to the Black code style. Flake8 is a powerful tool that checks the code's compliance to PEP8. Here is the guideline to automate the process using pre-commits to include black code formatter and flake8 checker. 

a. Install pre-commit: 
``` 
pip install pre-commit
```
b. Add pre-commit to requirements.txt

c. Define .pre-commit-config.yaml with the hooks you may want to include.
Below is a sample _.pre-commit-config.yaml_ file:
```
repos:
-   repo: https://github.com/ambv/black
    rev: stable
    hooks:
    - id: black
      language_version: python3.6
-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v1.2.3
    hooks:
    - id: flake8
```

Here is _.toml_ file for configuring black:
```
[tool.black]
line-length = 79
include = '\.pyi?$'
exclude = '''
/(
    \.git
  | \.hg
  | \.mypy_cache
  | \.tox
  | \.venv
  | _build
  | buck-out
  | build
  | dist
)/
'''
```

Below is the _.flake8_ configuration file:
```
[flake8]
ignore = E203, E266, E501, W503, F403, F401, C901
max-line-length = 79
max-complexity = 18
select = B,C,E,F,W,T4,B9
```
**Note:** Refer to this [page](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/06/21/precommits-using-black-and-flake8/) for a complete guideline on how to use pre-commit hook to include Black and Flake8. 

d. Execute pre-commit install to install git hooks in your .git/ directory.


```
pre-commit install 
```

7. To create a Pull Request (PR), you need to push your branch to the origin remote and press some buttons on GitHub. 
```
$ git push -u origin feature/Xfeature-update
```
Navigate to your fork of the project at the browser, there will be a "Compare & pull request" button beside your new branch at the top. 
Press the button! This will link you to the original project repository. 
Press the "Create pull request" button at the bottom and wait for review by the maintainers.
